### Privacy Policy – Terraform Associate Cheat Sheet

Effective date: 20 October 2025


Terraform Associate 003 Cheat Sheet (“Application”) is provided by Intelliiapps. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the Application on Android devices. By using the Application, you consent to the practices described below.


# 1. Information We Collect

Account & Authentication: Anonymous Firebase Authentication identifiers when you sign in (email address and name only if you voluntarily sign in with Google).
Analytics & Diagnostics: Usage data, screen views, crash reports, and performance metrics via Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics.
Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging tokens to deliver optional reminders and updates.
Advertising: Google Mobile Ads SDK collects advertising identifiers, device information, and coarse location to serve ads and measure performance.
Subscriptions & Billing: Google Play Billing handles payment details; we receive purchase tokens, product identifiers, and subscription status. No full payment information is stored by us.
Local Data: Study progress, preferences, and premium status are stored locally on the device and synchronized to Firebase Firestore under an anonymous user ID.


# 2. How We Use Information

Provide study content, track your progress, and personalize the experience.
Deliver banner and interstitial ads, unless you purchase a premium subscription.
Send optional push notifications (topic updates, reminders).
Diagnose crashes, detect bugs, and improve performance.
Verify purchases, manage subscriptions, and restore entitlement across devices.
Comply with legal requirements and protect our rights.


3. Sharing and Disclosure

We use trusted service providers (Google Firebase, Google Mobile Ads, Google Play Billing) to process data on our behalf under strict agreements.
We do not sell or rent personal data.
We may disclose information if required by law or to protect users, our services, or the public.


4. Advertising & Analytics Partners

Google AdMob: serves ads and may personalize content using the Advertising ID. You can opt out of personalized ads in your Android settings (Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization).
Firebase Analytics: aggregates usage statistics; you can disable analytics in the Application settings or through Android’s “Ads” privacy controls.
Crashlytics: collects crash logs and device metadata for debugging.


5. Children’s Privacy

The Application is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us and we will delete it.


6. Data Retention

We retain anonymous identifiers and usage data as long as necessary to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, and resolve disputes. Subscription records follow Google Play Billing retention requirements. You may request deletion of stored data at any time.


7. Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information (encrypted network connections, access controls, least-privilege policies). No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; use the Application at your own risk.


8. Your Rights & Choices

Opt out of personalized ads (device-level setting).
Disable analytics or notifications via in-app settings or system settings.
Request deletion of account-related data by emailing us (include your Firebase user ID if known).
Restore purchases from the settings screen after reinstallation.


9. International Transfers

Data may be processed on servers outside your country (including the United States). We ensure appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable laws.


10. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations. Updates will be posted in the Application and on our website, with a revised effective date. Continued use constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
